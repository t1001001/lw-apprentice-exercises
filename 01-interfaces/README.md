## 01-interfaces
**Problem:**

In this exercise, you're tasked with implementing an object-oriented design using abstract classes and inheritance. Specifically:
- Create an abstract base class **Geometry** with two abstract methods: **area()** and **perim()**. These methods should be implemented by all concrete subclasses.
- Create the two concrete classes **Rectangle** and **Circle** which both implement the **area()** and **perim()** methods.
- Define a **measure()** function that accepts any **Geometry** object and prints both its area and perimeter.

**Learning Outcome:**

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Understand how to define and work with **abstract classes**.
- Practice **inheritance** by extending an abstract class and implementing its abstract methods.
- Gain experience in using **polymorphism** where different classes share a common interface but have different implementations of methods like area() and perim().
- Develop the ability to design and structure classes around real-world objects with common properties and methods.
