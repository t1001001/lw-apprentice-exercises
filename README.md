# Apprentice Exercises
This repository contains a list of programming exercises designed for apprentices at **LEONHARD WEISS** specialising in **application development**.

These exercises are made to help apprentices understand core programming concepts and to build proficiency in various programming paradigms and tools.

Each exercise is structured to achieve specific learning outcomes - follow the instructions in the respective folders and refer to the READMEs for further clarification.

Feel free to explore each exercise, modify the code, and experiment with variations.

The goal is not only to complete each task, but to understand the underlying concepts and principles.
